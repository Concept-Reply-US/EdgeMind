# Code of Conduct

## Our Standards

EdgeMind is an internal project. We expect all team members to:

**Be Respectful**
- Treat colleagues with professionalism and courtesy
- Value diverse perspectives and experiences
- Listen actively and assume good intent

**Provide Constructive Feedback**
- Focus on the code, not the person
- Offer specific, actionable suggestions
- Acknowledge good work alongside improvement areas

**Communicate Effectively**
- Keep discussions focused and relevant
- Document decisions and rationale
- Respond to requests in a timely manner
- Use appropriate channels (Slack for quick questions, GitHub for code discussions)

## Unacceptable Behavior

- Personal attacks or derogatory comments
- Dismissing others' ideas without consideration
- Sharing confidential project information externally
- Ignoring team processes or blocking others' work

## Resolution

If conflicts arise:
1. Attempt to resolve directly with the person involved
2. Escalate to your team lead if needed
3. Contact HR for serious concerns

## Scope

This applies to all EdgeMind project spaces: GitHub, Slack channels, meetings, and related communications.
